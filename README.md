# Esprit

*Data Mining on the GLAWI French lexicon*


## Introduction

**Esprit** is a Java 8 console app performing simple but effective linguistics data mining on the [GLAWI](http://redac.univ-tlse2.fr/lexicons/glawi_en.html) lexicon.

In particular, its results are expressed as JSON files that constitute the data source of web pages published on [Marianne](https://github.com/giancosta86/Marianne).


## Requirements

Java 8u151 or later compatible is recommended to run the program.
